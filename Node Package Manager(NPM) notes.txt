What is Node package manager?

NPM is 2 things

Online Platform: 
- people can publish and share tools written in javascript.
- the tools can be used in the browser(front end), server(back end), and command line

- Command Line Tool: interact with the online platform i.e. Install and uninstall packages.
- A package is a tool that someone created and uploaded to the npm online platform.
- Every package has a version number. As packages change, version numbers change.
- Npm lets you keep packages up to date, and even switch package versions if need be.

*NPM is installed with nodeJS
